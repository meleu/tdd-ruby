This is an **incomplete** list of books and links I consulted and/or was inspired by to write this one.

- Learn Go with Tests, Chris James
- The Well-Grounded Rubyist, 3rd edition
- Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, Sandi Metz
- Tidy First?, Kent Beck
- Learning Test-Driven Development, Saleem Siddiqui
- [Ruby in 100 Minutes](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html), JumpstartLab

I'll be adding more references as I use them.
