# Learn Ruby with TDD

⚠ **This is a work in progress!** ⚠

This "book" is my attempt to teach idiomatic **Ruby** and **Test-Driven Development** (TDD).

Since we'll talk about Ruby, it's inevitable that you'll also learn about **Object-Oriented programming**. And since we'll use TDD, you'll inevitably also learn about **good software design**.

## Who this is for

- People who are interested in picking up Ruby.
- People who already know some Ruby but want to explore testing more.

I assume you have some experience with coding (any language) and understand the basic concepts of algorithms.

It's also expected that you're comfortable using the terminal (or at least not scared to use it).

## What you'll need

- A computer
- Installed Ruby (3.2+)
- A text editor
- A terminal

> TODO: add Ruby installation instructions.

For testing we're going to use Minitest, which is the testing framework that comes with the Ruby Standard Library.
