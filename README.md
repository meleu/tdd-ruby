# Learn TDD with Ruby

**This is a work in progress!**

This "book" is my attempt to teach TDD and idiomatic Ruby at the same time. Maybe also Object-Oriented Programming.

It's mainly aimed at people who already know how to code and want to quickly learn TDD and/or Ruby.
 
It's heavily inspired by the awesome [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/), by [Chris James](https://quii.dev/).

It's assumed you already have Ruby installed (I'll add installation instructions later).

The code here were tested on Ruby 3.2.

For testing we're going to use Minitest, which is the testing framework that comes with the Ruby Standard Library.
